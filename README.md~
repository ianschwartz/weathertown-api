# Weathertown, MA

## What is this?

It's a free, Open-Source Weather API, powered by Arduino Weather Stations. [I am
documenting my process in this blog series.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/arduino-raspberry-pi-zero-w-weather-station-api-pt-1-ian-schwartz)

## Oh cool. How do I use it?

Depends what you want to do. The API is free to use for pretty much anybody
that can find a purpose. Since it's served in JSON, you can use the data in
pretty much every language as you please. If you do something with it, let
us know!

## How can I contribute?

There are two primary ways to contribute:

1. Build a weather station and register it to build our data up.
2. If you think that something could have been done better, make a pull
request.

## It's not very useful.

You're not very useful. Eventually I'd like to build out the API so that you
can search for the station nearest you, as well as offering some different
ways to sort the data. We'll get there, just be patient.
